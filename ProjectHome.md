This [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748/) script automatically pokes people who have already poked you on Facebook.  It was inspired by Lukas Fragodt's Auto-Poke and EZ-Poke script, which are now defunct.

# Moved #
With the release of 3.5, I've moved the [autopoke script](http://code.google.com/p/tailgate/wiki/Greasemonkey_FacebookAutopoke) to [primary google project](http://code.google.com/p/tailgate/).
